json.hpp is the single required file in single_include/nlohmann or released here. You need to add:

#include <nlohmann/json.hpp>

// for convenience
using json = nlohmann::json;


Add this to the files you want to process JSON and set the necessary switches to enable C++11 (e.g., -std=c++11 for GCC and Clang).

You can further use file include/nlohmann/json_fwd.hpp for forward-declarations. 
The installation of json_fwd.hpp (as part of cmake's install step), can be achieved by setting -DJSON_MultipleHeaders=ON.
